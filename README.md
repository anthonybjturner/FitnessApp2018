# Fitness App 2018 web app
A web application for tracking nutrition, exercise, weight, and extra goals (eg. sleep).

<b>Nutrition:</b> Tracks the number of calories, protien, fiber, cholestrol, and other nutritional factors in a day, week, month and year. The nutrition page records the current intake and gives a ratio of a total suggested intake. For example: the user wants a max of 300mg for cholestrol, and the current intake is 50 mg; therefore, the current ratio shown is: 50mg of 300mg (16.6% reached).

<b>Exercise:</b> Tracks the exercises done in a day, week, month, and year. The exercise page records different preset exercies, such as: pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, steps, and user defined exercises. The user can then set goals to reach. For example: the user wants a max of 50 sit-ups, 100 push-ups, and 10 pull-ups; therefore, there is a list of these goals and status for each exercise if it that goal has been reached or not.

<b>Weight:</b> Tracks the person's daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly weight differences.

<b>Extra goals:</b> Allows for the person to add extra goals for there daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly activities.
For example, setting goals for getting 8 hours of sleep each night.

<b>TODO:</b> Add an enormous database of different foods with nutrition facts so the user does not need to input nutrition facts manually.
